# ConfigManager

The purpose of ConfigManager is to provide an efficient and easy to use API for everything relating to configuration
files for Minecraft java plugins. Although the scope of the project is aimed to address Minecraft java plugins, it can
be used for any Minecraft java program and you don't need to depend on the Spigot or Bungeecord API to use it.
